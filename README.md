# COVID_19-Test-Prediction-Using-CT-scan-Images

Creating a Web based Model which can Predict Covid 19 Result Using CT scan Images.
We are Using Deep Learning Model for Image classification 
1)- CNN this is a Convolutional neural network
2)- DenseNet 121 Model
3)- Inception V3 Model 
4)- Mobilenet Model 
5)- ResNet 50 Model
6)- VGG 16 Model

image.py is the python flask file for the backend 
covid_frontend is the frontend html code and style.css is the css file for the same.

In back end we have use VGG19 model for futher execution.


Project is under development
